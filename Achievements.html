My achevivments are that I graduated middle school and now I'm a freshman in Inwood Early College Highschool. I have a little work experience
because my mom is an entrepreneur so sometimes when she needs my help I'm there to be by her side. I feel like I have that team leadership and guiding
people where to go and what they should do depending on what they want to do.

* I've successfully lead a project and finished before the deadline.
* I like working as a team, if someone gets knoncked off track help them get back on there feet etc...
* I like communicating with people because if your not communicating with me that's going to cause issues like miscommunication and I won't
  know what your asking for which is huge for when being an entrepreneur when I'm older.
