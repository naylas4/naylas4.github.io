<p>hort Term Goals: 
My short term goals are graduating highschool with 80s-100s in all my classes and going to a college that will help me acquire a bussiness degree,
to enhance the successful entreprenuer I've always wanted to be.

Long Term Goals:
My long term goals are enhancing the feeling of becoming an entreprenuer to focus on bussiness growth, financial stability and personal fulfillment. 
But also creating a strong brand to thrive off of and provide for other people for what they need.</p>
